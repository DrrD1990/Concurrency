Preprint on arXiv: arXiv:2201.00754 [Ruodan, insert the URL link using markdown grammar]

Jupyter notebook
```
figure_X.ipynb
```
contains the code to produce fig X in the manuscript, where $X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, and $8$.

The following Python codes are also included:
```
SIS_Model_1prime.py -- to simulate the SIS epidemic spreading on Model 1'.
SIS_Model_2.py -- to simulate the SIS epidemic spreading on Model 2.
SIS_Model_1dprime.py -- to simulate the SIS epidemic spreading on Model 1''.
SIS_Model_3.py -- to simulate the SIS epidemic spreading on Model 3.
SIR_Model_1prime.py -- to simulate the SIR epidemic spreading on Model 1'.
SIR_Model_2.py -- to simulate the SIR epidemic spreading on Model 2.
SIR_Model_1dprime.py -- to simulate the SIR epidemic spreading on Model 1''.
SIR_Model_3.py -- to simulate the SIR epidemic spreading on Model 3.
